### Welcome to my GitHub 👋

🚀 Data Engineer | Software Engineer | Cloud Architect

I specialize in Python-driven data engineering, crafting ETL pipelines, automating workflows, and architecting scalable cloud solutions for data-intensive applications. My expertise includes building resilient systems to handle complex data workflows and optimizing performance in cloud-native environments.

With a solid background in Java, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture, I build resilient, high-performance systems that efficiently handle large-scale data processing, ensuring scalability and reliability in distributed environments.

My expertise spans:

✅ ETL & Data Pipelines – Designing and optimizing workflows for seamless data ingestion and transformation.

✅ Microservices & Distributed Systems – Designing and implementing scalable microservices architectures with Java and Spring Boot, ensuring resilience, efficiency, and seamless integration in distributed environments.

✅ Cloud & Infrastructure – Building containerized, cloud-native solutions using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS/GCP cloud, optimizing performance, scalability, and deployment efficiency.

✅ Batch & Streaming Data Processing – Developing robust batch and real-time data processing solutions, leveraging event-driven architectures to handle high-throughput, low-latency workloads.

Passionate about problem-solving, performance optimization, and automation, I thrive in environments that require engineering robust, scalable solutions for complex data challenges.

💡 Always exploring new technologies to enhance efficiency and drive innovation.
