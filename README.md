### Welcome to my GitHub 👋

Hi! My name is Emanuel and I am a hard-working Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience developing software, 2 years of experience as a scrum master using SAFe environment and junior trainer. I've worked mostly with Python and Java on microservices and ETL pipelines managing Big Data processes in the Cloud.

At the moment, what I like the most as technology is working with Google Cloud Platform, AI, K8s and Python 🐍 

I like to solve problems and make an impact with my work. 🛠
