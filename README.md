### Welcome to my GitHub 👋
Hi! My name is Emanuel and I am a hard-working Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience developing software from early stages to production, 2 years of experience as a scrum master using SAFe environment to manage agile teams and junior trainer (python) to share with others my skills. I've worked mostly with Python and Java on microservices and ETL pipelines managing Big Data processes in the Cloud. I've built in the past complex dynamic data pipelines, data applications, automation tools and applications and also contributed to the backend and frontend of different web applications. 

At the moment, what I like the most as technology is working with Python 🐍 in cloud developing dynamic scalable solutions. I am looking for the near future to get to the product management and get more involved into the business part of a project rather than the technical part.

I like to solve problems and make an impact with my work. 🛠
